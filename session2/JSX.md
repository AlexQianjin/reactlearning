## React with JSX
### React Elements as JSX
- Facebook’s React team released JSX when they released React to provide a concise
syntax for creating complex DOM trees with attributes. They also hoped to make
React more readable, like HTML and XML.
In JSX, an element’s type is specified with a tag. The tag’s attributes represent the
properties. The element’s children can be added between the opening and closing
tags.
