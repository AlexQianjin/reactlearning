## Hello World

The easiest way to get started with React is to use this Hello World example code on CodePen. You don't need to install anything; you can just open it in another tab and follow along as we go through examples. If you'd rather use a local development environment, check out the Installation page.

The smallest React example looks like this:

```
ReactDOM.render(
  <h1>Hello, world!</h1>,
  document.getElementById('root')
);
```

它在页面上渲染一个“Hello World”的头部标签。

接下来的几个章节会介绍如何去使用React。我们将会检验构建React应用的的砖块：元素和组件。一旦你掌握它们，你就可以从小的可重用的片段来创造复杂的应用。

## A Note on JavaScript

React is a JavaScript library, and so it assumes you have a basic understanding of the JavaScript language. If you don't feel very confident, we recommend refreshing your JavaScript knowledge so you can follow along more easily.

We also use some of the ES6 syntax in the examples. We try to use it sparingly because it's still relatively new, but we encourage you to get familiar with arrow functions, classes, template literals, let, and const statements. You can use Babel REPL to check what ES6 code compiles to.
