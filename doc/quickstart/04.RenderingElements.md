# __渲染元素__
元素是构建React应用程序最小的组成结构。

元素描述来你像在屏幕上看到的内容：
```
const element = <h1>Hello, world</h1>;
```
不像浏览器的DOM元素，React元素是普通的对象，创建代价很小。React DOM负责更新DOM去匹配React元素。

> 提示：

> 元素可能会和一个更加广泛知道的组件的概念容易混淆。我们将会在下个章节介绍组件。元素是组件的组成部分，我们鼓励你在跳过之前阅读本章节。

## __在DOM中渲染元素__

假设有一个\<div\>标签在你的HTML文件中：

```
<div id="root"></div>
```

我们叫这个DOM节点为根节点，因为所有的内容都会在里面由React DOM管理。

Applications built with just React usually have a single root DOM node. If you are integrating React into an existing app, you may have as many isolated root DOM nodes as you like.

To render a React element into a root DOM node, pass both to ReactDOM.render():

```
const element = <h1>Hello, world</h1>;
ReactDOM.render(
  element,
  document.getElementById('root')
);
```

It displays "Hello, world" on the page.

## __Updating the Rendered Element__

React elements are immutable. Once you create an element, you can't change its children or attributes. An element is like a single frame in a movie: it represents the UI at a certain point in time.

With our knowledge so far, the only way to update the UI is to create a new element, and pass it to ReactDOM.render().

Consider this ticking clock example:
```
function tick() {
  const element = (
    <div>
      <h1>Hello, world!</h1>
      <h2>It is {new Date().toLocaleTimeString()}.</h2>
    </div>
  );
  ReactDOM.render(
    element,
    document.getElementById('root')
  );
}

setInterval(tick, 1000);
```

It calls ReactDOM.render() every second from a setInterval() callback.

> Note:

> In practice, most React apps only call ReactDOM.render() once. In the next sections we will learn how such code gets encapsulated into stateful components.
We recommend that you don't skip topics because they build on each other.

## __React Only Updates What's Necessary__

React DOM compares the element and its children to the previous one, and only applies the DOM updates necessary to bring the DOM to the desired state.

You can verify by inspecting the last example with the browser tools:

Even though we create an element describing the whole UI tree on every tick, only the text node whose contents has changed gets updated by React DOM.

In our experience, thinking about how the UI should look at any given moment rather than how to change it over time eliminates a whole class of bugs.
